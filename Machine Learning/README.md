# Machine Learning
Welcome! This section is dedicated to my explorations and experiments in the field of machine learning. Here, you'll find various projects that demonstrate different algorithms, techniques, and applications of machine learning.

## Overview
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. In this subfolder, I aim to explore key concepts, implement algorithms, and analyze datasets to gain hands-on experience.

I plan on adding multiple projects in the future in this repository!
