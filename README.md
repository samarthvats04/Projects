# Projects

Welcome to my Projects repository! This space is dedicated to my personal learning journey, where I experiment with various coding projects and explore different technologies. 
The projects here range across different fields and levels of complexity, helping me to develop my programming skills and deepen my understanding.
Feel free to suggest me any changes and constructive criticism in any of the projects.

This repository includes:

Data Science and Machine Learning: Projects focused on data analysis, machine learning models, and data visualization.

Web Development: Small web apps and experiments using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend tools.

Algorithms and Data Structures: Practice problems and implementations to improve my problem-solving abilities.

This repository is a personal resource for tracking my growth, organizing my work, and documenting what I learn. 
Each project folder includes notes or README files where I reflect on what I learned, challenges I faced, and areas for improvement.
